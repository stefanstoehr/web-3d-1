### Kostenfreies Hosting eines 3D-Modells auf GitHub Pages 
- Using three.js for displaying a simple 3d-model in the browser.
- It is only super simple. It shows under the hood how you have to write the syntax for links to the ressources for three.js or 3d-data in your repository. By the way it is a working example for how to publish a project on GitHub-Pages.
- When you can't implement a 3d-model in your website for any reason you can set a link which opens a tab to your 3d-project on GitHub-Pages.
- Works fine for Firefox 68.5.0 Android and for Firefox 74.0 MacOS. Safari 10.1.2 is not working but no error is displayed in the console and every ressource is loaded. 
- The original code is from three.js and you can find it here: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js
- In my case I build the project on top of this: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/webgl_loader_collada.html
