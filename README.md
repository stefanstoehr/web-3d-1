# collada

Using three.js for displaying a simple 3d-model in the browser.

The result is here on GitHub-Pages: https://stewahn.github.io/collada/

The original code is from three.js and you can find it here: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js

In my case I build the project on top of this: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/webgl_loader_collada.html

Thanks to three.js - an amazing work.
