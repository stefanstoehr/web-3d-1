# collada

Using three.js for displaying a simple 3d-model in the browser.

It is only super simple. It shows under the hood how you have to write the syntax for links to the ressources for three.js or 3d-data in your repository. By the way it is a working example for how to publish a project on GitHub-Pages.

When you can't implement a 3d-model in your website for any reason you can set a link which opens a tab to your 3d-project on GitHub-Pages. The result of this repository is here on GitHub-Page: https://stewahn.github.io/collada/

Works fine for Firefox 68.5.0 Android and for Firefox 74.0 MacOS.
Safari 10.1.2 is not working but no error is displayed in the console and every ressource is loaded. 

The original code is from three.js and you can find it here: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js

In my case I build the project on top of this: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/webgl_loader_collada.html

Thanks to three.js
