# collada

Using three.js for displaying a simple 3d-model in the browser.

It is only super simple. It shows under the hood how you have to write the syntax for links to the ressources of three.js or 3d-data in your repository. By the way it is a working example for how to publish a project on GitHub-Pages.

When you can't implement a 3d-model in your website for any reason you can set a link which opens a tab to your 3d-project on GitHub-Pages. The result of this repository is here on GitHub-Page: https://stewahn.github.io/collada/

The original code is from three.js and you can find it here: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js

In my case I build the project on top of this: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/webgl_loader_collada.html

Thanks to three.js - an amazing work.
